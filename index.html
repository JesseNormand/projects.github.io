					<i>Hello!</i> My name is Jesse Normand, and in that picture I am holding an automated real estate
					service web platform my team and I created and brought to market nationally.
					That appliation is my most recent production.
					In this website, I will show you some of the business logic, 
					programming, and data science methods I used to help guide business 
					decisions and market strategies for projects like that application development.
					
			
				<p>
					I love taking on new projects and getting to the root of business solutions. As a seasoned
entrepreneur I have had the unique opportunity to immerse myself in all functions of business
design and growth. I developed a passion for analyzing, monitoring, and measuring business
and financial processes with statistical tools and methods. My extensive experience as a
business operator and developer combined with my robust data analytical skillset, makes me
uniquely qualified for taking on complex and high-visibility projects.
				</p>
	


				<p>
					I use R, SQL, Excel, Shiny, Power BI, Tableau, and statistical and mathematical methods to achieve insights and solutions. 
					Please click on Portfolio to view some of my recent concepts and projects, and check back soon for new developments. 
					Thank you for stopping by!
