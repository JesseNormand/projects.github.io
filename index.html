					<i>Hello!</i> My name is Jesse Normand and that picture is me holding an automated real estate service web platform that I worked on with my team members to bring to market nationally. 
                    That platform was the most recent project I worked on. In this website I will show you some of the business logic, programming, and data science concepts I used to help guide the business 
					decisions and market strategies.

				<p>
				    A little bit about my background. I love taking on new projects and anayzing business questions, and for this reason I have made a career out of entrepreneurship which has allowed me to 
					immerse myself in all things related to the functions of a business. <b>Over time, I developed a skill and passion for analyzing, monitoring, and measuring business, and financial 
					processes with statistical tools and methods.</b> I believe my extensive experience as a business operator and developer
                    combined with my data analytical and scientific skills, makes me uniquely qualified for taking on complex and high visibilty projects.
